# Learning Java Spring Boot Session
This was a practice project where I learned how to manipulate session in a Spring Boot app.

### Objectives:
* Counter increments when the user visits the page
* Counter increments by 2 when selecting the Add 2 button
* Count is saved in session, and only cleared when the user presses the reset button
